# Medic

This repository contains the frontend for the Medic device management system.

## Frontend

The React application lives under `frontend/` and follows a clean architecture folder structure:

```
frontend/
  src/
    application/    # application services and context
    domain/          # domain entities
    presentation/    # UI components, pages, routes
```

To run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
